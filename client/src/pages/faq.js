        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "0px" }}>
          Team Poker® is the Patented System that allows both Individuals and
          Teams to compete in poker tournaments. Any poker game can be used in
          TP tournaments. Tournament Directors can split the Prize Pool Payouts
          from 0-100% to the individuals or teams. As example a typical split
          might be 60% to Teams and 40% to Individuals; or, Teams could play for
          “Trophies” only.

        <p className={faqStyles.title}>2) How is Team Poker® (TP) Played</p>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
          TP is a poker tournament system not a poker game. Any Poker Game can
          be used with the TP System. Individuals play TP tournaments games like
          they would any other poker tournament. There is no difference in how
          the poker games are played by the individuals. TP is a Team Scoring,
          Team Handicapping, and Seating Protocol System that Tournament
          Directors can structure as they see fit for the best results for their
          Poker Room.{" "}
        </p>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
          <br /> Tournament Directors (TD) determine what size teams they want
          in any specific tournament. Any size team is possible (e.g. Teams of
          2, 3, 4, Players etc., and Classes of Teams (e.g. Men VS Women,
          Countries VS Countries, etc.) can overlay any tournament as well.
          Also, TDs can structure the team size to vary (e.g. Max and Min Size
          of Teams) in the same tournament using the TP Handicap System (e.g. 4
          Max – 2 Min players per Team; 3 Max – 1 Min per Team … yes it is
          possible for teams structures of 1 Individual with the TP Handicap).
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          <br />
          The only change to the normal poker tournament rules (e.g. as
          identified in pokerTDA.com) is the TP Non-Contact Rule which does not
          allow Teammates to play on the same table with Opponents; Therefore,
          Collusion is not possible among teammates in TP tournaments.

          3) How does the Team Poker® (TP) Tournament System Work
        </p>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
          TEAM POKER® PATENTED PROCESS allows both Individuals and Teams to play
          and compete in poker tournaments for a percentage of the prize pool.
          Teams can use the system to maximize their skill and luck to a larger
          prize pool payout, and Poker Team League Play.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          TP is played for Individual Finish Positions and payouts, as is any
          other poker tournament. The Tournament Director determines and
          advertises the structure of the tournament prior to the start like any
          poker tournament. However, in addition to typical tournament
          structures the directors also determines the size of the teams playing
          and as mentioned the prize pool spit between teams and individuals.

              The Individual Finish Positions (IFP) of players determines
              payouts to Individuals like any poker tournament. It is preferable
              that all IFPs are calculated in the exit count, but the IFP count
              can start at any manageable place the directors determine. The
              Inverse of the IFP Count establish the Individuals’ Points that
              contribute to the Team Score and is used to determine the Team
              Finish Position and Payouts. The Tie Breaker for Team Score/
              Finish Position and Payouts is the Team with the Highest IFP.

                TEAM POKER® is flexible so Tournament Directors can determine
                the structure that best fits their poker room needs; and, any
                size team using the handicap is possible, or tournaments can
                require equal sized teams to compete. Individuals place in the
                tournaments as they always have, based on their Individual
                Finish Positions (IFP) in the Finish Count. The Count can start
                at any manageable point in the tournament, and there can be
                collective finishes in large tournaments where several players
                have the same IFP as a result of the inability to determine and
                account for unique exit positions. An individual’s contribution
                to their Team Score (Points) is calculated from the inverse of
                their IFP to the full Count.

              Teams can Handicap themselves, when TDs allow team size to vary,
              by playing with less than the maximum number of Players per Team
              allowed. The TP is a “Reverse Handicap” so player can potentially
              maximize their team’s skill factor (e.g. If the Team Structure is
              4 Max and 2 Min a team of 2 would have their team point score
              multiplied by the ratio of 4/2 or 2 X the team points).

          4) What is the Option for TP Full-Contact Seating Protocol
        </p>
        <p>
          The TP System offers an Optional Seating Protocol for “Full-Contact”
          where the Seating Protocol is Totally Random, and Teammates can play
          on the same table with Opponents. Also, Seating Protocol can be set so
          Teammates are equally distributed with Opponents on the same tables,
          Since Teammates are known it does not fit the true definition of
          “Collusion”, but it is obvious that teammates could use signals or
          chip dumping to help their team. Although Full-Contact TP is not the
          preferred TP seating protocol we maintain this option as a unique and
          interesting way to play with poker teams and that TDs may decide to
          play for Special Full-Contact Events. A tournament structure that may
          work with TP Full-Contact are teams of 2 players with teammates on the
          same tables.
